**Video based human action recognition using reservoir computing**

In the last few years, human action recognition has been under great research in the field of computer vision as it has vast application umbrella such as gaming, robotics, fitness apps, and physical therapy etc. There are many challenges in recognition of human action recognition when using video data sets. To study challenges of video-based human action, we are using an optoelectronic system that use camera and spatial light modulator (SLM) as hardware along with Reservoir Computing (RC) as machine learning technique.

Reservoir Computing (RC) is a human brain-inspired machine learning method that is adaptable, has short training durations, and makes use of dynamical systems' inherent information-processing capabilities. The basic training method used in reservoir computing, which only includes training the output layer, avoids problems that are common when training recurrent neural networks, such as training on the very large data set. As a result, reservoir computing is particularly well suited to hardware implementation. Optical implementations are of special relevance in terms of improving calculation speeds and power consumption.
